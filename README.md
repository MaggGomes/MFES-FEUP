Ugly Fruit
This project aims to model all the information managed by Ugly Fruit. About half of the food
produced in the world each year goes to waste. The reasons for this waste are many and occur
throughout the agrifood chain. The “Fruta Feia” cooperative arises from the need to reverse such fruit
and vegetable standardization trends that have nothing to do with food safety and quality issues. This
project aims to combat market inefficiency by creating an alternative market for "ugly" fruit and
vegetables that can change consumption patterns.
